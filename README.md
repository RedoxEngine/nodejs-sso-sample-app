This is a very rough sample application that demostrates validating a JWT in nodejs

To get started:

`cd app`
`npm install`
`npm start`

The application will be running on http://localhost:8080 by default. The port can be changed by using the `PORT` environment variable.

Also make sure you export the secret configued in your SSO destination.

`export SSO_SECRET="<generated in Redox Dashboard"`
